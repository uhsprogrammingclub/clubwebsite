# Building a Website for UHS Devopment Club

Construct a website to serve as a platform to post, upload, and try out ideas.

Ensure all changes function properly in Google Chrome and Firefox at a minimum before committing changes. If you want something to be made live immedietly, commit your changes and then email me at nathaniel.corley@sfuhs.org and I will complete the FTP.

Design will be created using Bootstrap framework; any back-end that exists will use (probably) PHP or Node.js if we're feeling adventurous. Feel free to add any stylist flourishes you see fit, but make sure they don't break anything existing. That would make us unhappy.
